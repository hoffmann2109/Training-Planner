## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (for managing dependencies)
- [JFreeChart Library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/) (for charting) â€“ You can add it to your project by including the appropriate Maven dependency or adding the JAR to your project.

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/training-planner.git
   cd training-planner
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if using Maven):
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```
3. Configure the Database (see Configuration below)

4. Compile and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="MyFrame"
   ```

## Configuration

### Database Configuration (for PostgreSQL Export)

1. **Set Up PostgreSQL**: Make sure PostgreSQL is running and create a database named `TrainingData`. You can create the necessary table with the following SQL command:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE training_data (
       week INT,
       exercise VARCHAR(50),
       muscle_group VARCHAR(50),
       sets INT,
       reps INT,
       rpe DOUBLE PRECISION
   );
   ```

2. **Secure Database Credentials**: Add your database password in a `.env` file located in the project root (same directory as `pom.xml`):
   ```plaintext
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

3. **Environment Variable**: Ensure that `.env` is included in `.gitignore` to keep it secure:
   ```plaintext
   # Environment variables
   .env
   ```

4. **Load Environment Variable**: The application will read the `DB_PASSWORD` from the `.env` file, so make sure you have this file correctly configured before running the application.

## Usage

### Loading Data

1. Launch the application.
2. Click the **"Upload CSV"** button to select a CSV file containing your exercises. The CSV format should look like this:
   ```
   ExerciseName;MuscleGroup;SetCount;Weight;Reps;RPE
   Bench Press;CHEST;3;100;10,10,10;8,8,8
   ```
3. The loaded data will populate the main window with analysis information.

### Filtering by Muscle Group

1. Select a muscle group from the drop-down menu to filter displayed exercises to that muscle group only.

### Exporting Data to PostgreSQL

1. Click the **"Export"** button to save your weekly training data to the PostgreSQL database. This stores data such as week number, exercises, sets, reps, and RPE.
